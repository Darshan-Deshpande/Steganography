# Steganography
Steganography is the method of hiding secret data in any image/audio/video. In a nutshell, the main motive of steganography is to hide the intended information within any image/audio/video that doesn’t appear to be secret just by looking at it.The idea behind image-based Steganography is very simple. Images are composed of digital data (pixels), which describes what’s inside the picture, usually the colors of all the pixels. Since we know every image is made up of pixels and every pixel contains 3-values (red, green, blue).
Here I have used the LSB method (Least significant bit). The idea behind LSB embedding is that if we change the last one or two bit value of a pixel, there won't be much visible change in the color.Let "image_to_hide" be the image we want to hide and "image_to_hide_in" be the image we want to hide the data inside(in  this case the data is another image).So we will store the most significant bits of the image_to_hide in the Least significant bits of the pixels of image_to_hide_in. 
In this project I have used Pillow library to handle and modify images.
